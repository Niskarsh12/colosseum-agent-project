# Privacy Design Notes

## Front-running Risks
Agents operating on public mempools are susceptible to sandwich attacks. 

## Future Mitigations
1. **Jito Bundles**: Use Jito-Solana to send transactions directly to validators.
2. **ZK-Proofs**: Integrate privacy layers like Light Protocol for shielded state.
3. **Private RPCs**: Use authenticated endpoints to reduce broadcast exposure.
