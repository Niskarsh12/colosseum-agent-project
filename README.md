# Solana Yield Optimizer

An agentic prototype for optimizing yield on Solana with a focus on privacy-preserving transaction routing.

## Features
- **Privacy Adapters**: Integrated structure for Sipher-style stealth addresses to prevent front-running.
- **Deterministic Planning**: Logic for calculating optimal yield paths across protocols.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Built entirely with the Python Standard Library.

## Running the Project

To run the optimizer simulation:
```cmd
python main.py
```

## Running Tests

```cmd
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
