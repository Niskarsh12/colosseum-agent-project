# Solana Yield Optimizer

An autonomous agent prototype for optimizing yield on Solana with a focus on verifiable reasoning and privacy-preserving logic.

## Features
- **Deterministic Planning**: Logic is separated from execution to ensure verifiable reasoning.
- **Privacy Adapters**: Sensitive data is hashed before being logged or transmitted.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Built using only the Python standard library.

## Running the Project

To run the optimizer simulation:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
